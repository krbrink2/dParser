# dParser
Created by Robert Thomas and Kyle Brinker.

Command line application that takes a mathematical expression as an argument and evaluates it. The expression is parsed and converted into a tree structure before recursive evaluation.

Uses library dmath to perform operations.

Currently a WIP.
